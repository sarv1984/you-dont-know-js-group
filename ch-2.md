## Shea

- Dense chapter... lots of good "refresher" info.

**What I learned**
- [Each File is a Program](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/ch2.md#each-file-is-a-program) - I'm starting to think we may not be structureing our files/modules in the best way.  I think I'll have a better persective when we read the [modules chapter in the "Scope and Closure" book](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch8.md).

**Questions for the Group**
- Place holder
